Getting Started
=================
What to craft to get started. Every item has a recipe, you can either use the vanilla recipe book or a recipe viewing mod.<br />
[[Flour]](#flour) [[Dough]](#dough) [[Spigot]](#spigot) [[Coffee Beans]](#coffee-beans) [[Tea / Seeds]](#tea-and-seeds)

Flour
------
Start by making a Mortar, this item will allow you to craft:
* Flour (From Wheat)
* Rice Flour (From Rice)
* Potato Starch (From Potatoes)
* Matcha Tea Powder

Dough
-----
To make any dough, use water and a flour/starch. Once you obtain dough, you can craft:
* Cake Bases (used when decorating cakes)
* Cookie Doughs
* Cupcake Doughs
* Donuts / Gluten Free Donuts
* Pies
* Poptarts

Spigot
------
After crafting a Spigot, right click any tree to extract syrup.

Coffee Beans
------
Coffee beans have a 1/8 chance of dropping when breaking cocoa beans. Once you have coffee beans, you can craft:
* Cold Brew
* Coffee
* Mocha Beans (Makes Mocha)
* Espresso Beans (Makes Macchiato, Latte, Espresso, Cappuccino, and Americano)

Tea and Seeds
---
All seeds can be found when breaking tall grass (much like normal wheat seeds), this includes:
* Mint Seeds
* Rice Seeds
* Strawberry Seeds
* Tea Seeds
* Peanuts

Tea Seeds (when grown) will yield a random tea leaf:
* Green Tea
* Matcha Tea
* Oolong Tea
* White Tea
* Yellow Tea

Any tea can be smelted to make Dried Tea, which is used for making Black Tea.

To make you tea, you must make a tea bag first, then combine the tea leaf and tea bag in the crafting table. (Except Matcha - Matcha requires just an Empty Cup and Water.) Combine the tea bag with an empty cup and some water, and presto - you got tea.
